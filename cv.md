# Briefly About Myself:

I started my journey to junior front-end specialist about a year ago, during the pandemic.
Then I lost my job and realized that IT is the future and a stable job for any company anywhere in the world.
I got carried away in this process and being already at another job I continue to study and not abandon the idea of ​​moving to IT.
I set myself the goal that in the spring of 2023 I will still become a junior specialist and achieve this no matter what it costs me!
