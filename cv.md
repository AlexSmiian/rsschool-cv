# Briefly About Myself:

I started my journey to junior front-end specialist about a year ago, during the pandemic.
Then I lost my job and realized that IT is the future and a stable job for any company anywhere in the world.
I got carried away in this process and being already at another job I continue to study and not abandon the idea of ​​moving to IT.
I set myself the goal that in the spring of 2023 I will still become a junior specialist and achieve this no matter what it costs me!

## Skills and Proficiency:

## Code example:
**Highest and Lowest**

In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.
**Notes**
-All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
-There will always be at least one number in the input string.
-Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.

```
function highAndLow(numbers){
  let num = numbers.split(' ');
  return Math.max(...num) + ' ' + Math.min(...num);
}
